      <!--<li>If your school is not listed in the doc, let us know!</li>-->
      <li>You will be reimbursed for the travel costs after the event</li>
      <li>If you’re in highschool, reference the university/college closest to you.</li>
      <li>If your transportation requires advanced purchase, it must be purchased by/on August 19th. If you don’t book by then, your transportation will not be reimbursed.</li>
      <li>If your transportation does not require advanced purchase, you must tell us how you will be getting to Waterloo by August 19th as well.</li>
      <li>Once you have made your booking, we will not cover any change fees.</li>
      <li>If we are sending a bus to your campus, your reimbursement is $0</li>
      <li>We will not cover any unnecessary travel fees, such as an upgrades, food, etc.</li>
      <li>If your ticket is purchased by someone else, please let us know of this via email. </li>
      <li>Do not count on us to cover the cost of transportation to/from the YYZ (Toronto Airport) [see next point] nor to/from the airport in your home area. We also do not cover any fees that may come from your travel. </li>
      <li>We will be providing shuttle services to and from our campus to Toronto Pearson Airport on Friday and Sunday. If you miss the shuttles (there will be a few) then the rule above applies (no cost coverage).</li>
      <li>If possible, please consider traveling with a car with a group of fellow participants. We will cover the cost of gas (20 cents/km driven) and the cost of rental for a car. There is parking on campus, though it’s somewhat limited, so make sure to reach out to us so we can direct you to the best places. </li>
      <li>Once you have made your purchase, please upload all receipts to the website (please make sure this receipt shows how much was paid and that you actually made the purchase).</li>
      <li>If you research transportation from your location and find the travel cap to be unreasonable, email us at <a href="mailto:hello@hackthenorth.com">hello@hackthenorth.com</a>.</li>
    </ul>
   
    <p><b>Note that if you book tickets, but then do not show up to Hack the North, you will not be reimbursed.</b></p>

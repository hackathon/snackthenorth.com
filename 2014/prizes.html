<p>We provide iOS, Android and Web SDKs to help you stream audio to the to the Wit API. After you send your voice or text command to Wit, we'll figure out the user's intent and send back JSON. So if your user says, “Wake me up tomorrow at 7,” Wit will send back something like {“intent”: “set_alarm”, “datetime”: “20140920T070000”}.</p>

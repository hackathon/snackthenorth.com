    <h4>Introduction</h4>

    <p>
      Hack the North is a community hackathon intended for collaboration and
      learning in the student community.
    <p>

    <p>
      We value the participation of each member of the student community and
      want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.
      Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to
      other attendees throughout the hackathon.
    </p>

    <p>
      To make clear what is expected, all attendees and speakers at this
      hackathon are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct.
      Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.
    </p>


    <h4>The Code</h4>

    <p>
      Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal comments,
      hacks, or other online activity related to gender, sexual orientation,
      physical or mental ability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, physical
      appearance, race, religion, sexual images, deliberate intimidation,
      stalking, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
    </p>

    <p>
      Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply
      immediately. If participants fail to comply they will be asked to leave
      the event.
    </p>

    <p>
      Be careful and mindful of the words that you choose. Remember that sexist,
      racist, and other exclusionary comments and hacks can be offensive to
      those around you.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct,
      the hackathon organizers will take any action they deem appropriate,
      including warning the offender or expulsion from the hackathon.
